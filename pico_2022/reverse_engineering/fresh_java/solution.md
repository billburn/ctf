# Solution

1. Download the file from the website
2. The file is a Java .class file
3. Decompile using procyon ```procyon KeygenMe.class > decompiled.txt```
4. We can see the flag, in reverse
5. I simply brute-forced the key and wrote down the letters in reverse
6. I am going to write a Python script to grab the flag

## Flag
```
picoCTF{700l1ng_r3qu1r3d_738cac89}
```
