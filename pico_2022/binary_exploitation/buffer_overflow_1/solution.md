# Solution

1. Download the source and the binary file
2. Chmod the binary withg +x 
3. Use gdb to search through the functions (win looks interesting), make note of its memory address
4. Since we know this is likely a buffer overflow, we use pattern create to create a 100byte pattern ```pattern create 100 pattern.txt```
5. Run the binary, in gdb with the input of pattern: ```run < pattern.txt```

## Win funciton memory address
```
0x080491f6
```

## Pattern
```
pattern create 100 pattern.txt
```
