# Solution

1. Downloaded the PCAP file
2. Opened it up and searched for the string "pico", but didnt see anything
3. Since the data in the PCAP was small, I followed the TCP stream and the flag was there
4. I reassembled the flag, which had spaces

## Flag
```
p i c o C T F { p 4 c k 3 7 _ 5 h 4 r k _ c e c c a a 7 f }
picoCTF{p4ck37_5h4rk_ceccaa7f}
```
